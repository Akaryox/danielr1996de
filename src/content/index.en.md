# Daniel Richter

Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Daniel, a software developer from germany specialized on modern frontend technologies like React, Next.js & tailwindcss.
Personally I also do a lot of backend development with Go & NodeJS or Deno as well as DevOps topics like Kubernetes

While doing this I always watch out for code qualitiy and maintainability, furthermore I try to keep up to date with the newest developments in the IT industry.

In my spare time I like to play Volleyball, ride the bike or go hiking. When the weather is too bad I like to experiment with my 3D printer and microcontrollers.
